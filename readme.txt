My website is a online store where gamers can buy video games online. I took inspiration from other online video game stores like Steam and Epic Games store.



I didn't change much from my initial prototype. Some things are different only because I had a hard til with coding it to look exactly like the prototype.

I also made the website responsive with mobile devices

to make the checkout page I used a tutorial on W3Schools

For this resit I made changes to my original assignment based on the feedback I recieved on that original assignment. 
I made all the changes that the teacher requested. 
Image file sizes were scaled down to be less than 200kb. 
Ease of navigation was fixed by making the navigation bar stick to the top of the screen. 
I added css variables to my css in order to not repeat myself so much.
I also made my HTML code more semantic.
